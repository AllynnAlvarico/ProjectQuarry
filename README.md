making a simple game in visual basic

Welcome to my self-improvement programming journey. In this repository, I am embarking on a thrilling adventure to enhance my coding skills while developing a simulation game using the power of Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET).

this is just to improve my programming skills and learn how to create a functioning program and game.

email me if you have a question(s) about my code and if you see any bugs or how to improve my program.
thank you allynn_alvarico@yahoo.com
